# Player Banner

Simple script to automatically reject all runs from a given player that are submitted to either https://www.speedrun.com/mcbe or https://www.speedrun.com/mcbece.

For the script to work you must have a file named `api_key` in the same directory containing your API key.

Run the script with either `./ban.py <playername>` or `python3 ban.py <playername>`.
